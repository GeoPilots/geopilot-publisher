AI Can Predict Behavior — Not Intent

AI is getting very good at predicting what people will do.

What you’ll click.
What you’ll buy.
What you’re likely to watch next.

But there’s something AI still doesn’t understand.

Intent.

Most AI systems learn from past behavior.
They look for patterns across large datasets and use those patterns to make predictions.

If you’ve done something before, the model assumes you’re likely to do it again.

And statistically, that often works.

But behavior and intent are not the same thing.

People act for many reasons.
Habit. Convenience. Pressure. Emotion. Timing.

Two people can take the same action for completely different reasons.

AI doesn’t see reasons.
It sees outcomes.

When a model predicts behavior, it isn’t asking why someone acted.
It’s estimating what is likely to happen next.

That distinction matters.

Consider online recommendations.

If someone clicks on a product once, the system may assume interest.
But the click could mean curiosity, comparison, or even a mistake.

The behavior is the same.
The intent is not.

The same problem appears in risk assessment, hiring tools, and fraud detection.

A pattern may look suspicious, reliable, or valuable —
but the underlying motivation is invisible to the model.

This is where false confidence creeps in.

When predictions are accurate most of the time,
it’s tempting to treat them as understanding.

But prediction without context is fragile.

Small changes in circumstances can flip intent,
even when behavior looks familiar.

Humans adjust naturally.
We ask questions.
We notice contradictions.
We change our interpretation.

AI doesn’t do that unless we design systems to support it.

This doesn’t mean AI is useless.
It means it needs boundaries.

AI works best when it supports human judgment,
not when it replaces it.

Understanding intent requires context, nuance, and interpretation —
things that don’t live neatly in data.

So while AI can predict behavior with impressive accuracy,
it still relies on us to interpret meaning.

And that’s a reminder worth keeping in mind
as we automate more decisions.

Because behavior is visible.
Intent is not.
