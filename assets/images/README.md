# Images

This directory contains image assets for the GeoPilots project.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `landing-page-hero.png`, `user-profile-icon.svg`)
- Optimize images before uploading to reduce file size
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, WebP
- All binary image files are tracked with Git LFS

## Organization

You may create subdirectories to organize images by feature, page, or category as needed.
