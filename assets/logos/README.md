# Logos

This directory contains logo assets for the GeoPilots project.

## Guidelines

- Store different variations of the logo (full color, monochrome, light/dark versions)
- Include multiple formats (SVG for scalability, PNG for raster use)
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `geopilots-logo-full-color.svg`, `geopilots-logo-white.png`)
- Maintain original source files

## Organization

Suggested subdirectories:
- `primary/` - Main logo variations
- `secondary/` - Alternative logo marks
- `wordmarks/` - Text-only logo variations
