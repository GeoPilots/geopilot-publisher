# Audio

This directory contains audio assets for the GeoPilots project.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `notification-sound.mp3`, `background-music.wav`)
- Use appropriate formats for the use case (MP3 for general use, WAV for high quality)
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AAC
- All audio files are tracked with Git LFS

## Organization

You may create subdirectories to organize audio by type (e.g., effects, music, voiceovers).
